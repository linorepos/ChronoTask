# AngularToDoList

A simple to-do list application built with Angular, featuring server-side rendering (SSR) and a JSON server backend.

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Enhanced performance and SEO with Angular Universal.
- **JSON Server Backend:** Mock REST API for to-do item management (port 5000).
- **CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- npm (v9.x or later)
- Angular CLI (install globally via `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone

2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Install dependencies (npm install)

## Running the Application
npm start
npm run server

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
